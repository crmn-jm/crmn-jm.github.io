        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <img src="assets/image.jpg" alt="Carmen's photo" style="width:200px;">
        <p>Graduated in 2018 with an extraordinary end-of-degree award from the University of Granada. During the Master's Degree at the Polytechnic University of 
            Madrid I obtained a grant to be visiting student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). My doctorate and research career has been focused on 
            medical data analysis by means of machine learning techniques and statistical analysis. I have addressed the small sample size problem in neuroimaging 
            with novel approaches to data partitioning and performance evaluation. Moreover, I have also developed algorithms to be implemented in clinical practice, 
            e.g., as an aid to dementia diagnosis when using the Clock Drawing and statistical agnostic mapping tools that avoid the use of classical statistical
            techniques (and their data-related assumptions). Granted with a FPU contract, my PhD thesis dissertation was awarded with honours 
            (Cum Laude) and had the International Mention as a result of an international research stay (funded by the FPU Short Stays grant) in the Department of 
            Psychiatry of the University of Cambridge (United Kingdom). During my postdoctoral period, I completed two additional research stays: 
            three months at The Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (Germany) and six months at the University of Cambridge, focusing on developing methods 
            with real clinical applicability. 
            I am currently a Juan de la Cierva fellow at the University of MÃ¡laga, Spain.</p>
